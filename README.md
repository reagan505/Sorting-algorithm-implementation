# Sorting-algorithm-implementation
This Dart project generates a random list of integers to compare the performance of **Counting Sort** and **Bubble Sort** algorithms. Using `measureSort`, it times each sorting method, displaying execution time and sorted results. This setup aids in understanding algorithm efficiency and performance for varied data sizes.
